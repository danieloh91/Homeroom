# Homeroom
HomeRoom is a web platform through which instructors can communicate to their students via broadcasting information that each of their students will receive. Students receive the announcements of their instructors via a feed shown on their user pages. Students are able to "enroll" into an instructor's class by sending a request to follow them, which instructors can confirm or deny that request. This application ensures that students receive the latest information on their assignments while instructors can relay that information in a secure manner.
